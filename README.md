# AI_Flight_Assistant_chatbot

This is a chatbot powered by OpenAI API which can book tickets to locations which you ask it to fictitiously, Moreover, it also generates images of that location and translates the prompt that you provide in the language that you want. It also uses the TTS API to speak out the responses from the chatbot.

You need to have an OpenAI API Key with some balance in it so as to inculcate its functionality. Otherwise you can tweak this code a bit to use an open source frontier model.

You can tweak the Enable_images variable to False if you do not want to spend money on generating images from OpenAI.
